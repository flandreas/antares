### High quality rendering

Draw beautiful circuits in publishing quality.

![Counter](/assets/images/design/counter.png)

### Rich component set

Use components from a rich built-in component library.

<img src="/assets/images/design/rich-component-set.png" width="200">

### Hierarchical design

Use your own circuits as subcircuits in other circuits. Organize these subcircuits
in libraries to use them in multiple projects.

<img src="/assets/images/design/hierarchical-design.png" width="300">

### Symbol editor

Use the built-in symbol editor to draw custom symbols for your subcircuits.

<img src="/assets/images/design/symbol-editor.png" width="150">

Or you can forgo to design them and let Antares automatically generate them using two different styles. And if you like, adjust the symbol after it has been generated.

| Narrow | Wide |
| --- | ----- |
| <img src="/assets/images/user-manual/subcircuits/generate_narrow-symbol.png" width="200"> | <img src="/assets/images/user-manual/subcircuits/generate_wide_symbol.png" width="200"> |

### Various gate symbol styles

Choose your preferred gate symbol style.

| Style | Example |
| --- | ----- |
|IEC | <img src="/assets/images/design/iec-symbol-style.png" width="300"> |
|ANSI | <img src="/assets/images/design/ansi-symbol-style.png" width="300"> |
|Verbose | <img src="/assets/images/design/verbose-symbol-style.png" width="300">  |

### Versatile gates

Use gates with up to 8 inputs and optional input negation, and even with multi-bit inputs and outputs.

<img src="/assets/images/design/gate-versatility.png" width="400">

### DIL symbols

Use the pre-defined DIL shape to wrap your custom circuit in a DIL shape, or
use the 74xx library in the Antares assets project.

<img src="/assets/images/design/dil.png" width="400">

### Dynamic and interactive custom symbols

Add subcircuit components like switches, LEDs or probes to your subcircuit's custom symbol
to let it display subcircuit state, and to let the user interact with internals
of your subcircuit, e.g. by pressing switches on the symbol.

<img src="/assets/images/design/controls.png" width="400">

### Individual symbol customization

Rotate or mirror a subcircuit's symbol, and even edit it individually for
optimal integration into its host circuit.

<img src="/assets/images/design/symbol-customization.png" width="300">

### True bi-directional signal flow

Pins, wires and wire splitters in Antares can be truly bi-directional, allowing
you to build bus-like circuits with ease.

### Wire bundles and bus-style wires

Combine multiple 1-bit wires to multi-bit bundles and denote bus-like wires.

<img src="/assets/images/design/wire-types.png" width="350">

### Various wire logic

Choose whether different signals on the same wire should be considered a conflict, or
whether they should be OR-ed together.

| Conflict | Wired-OR |
| --- | ----- |
| <img src="/assets/images/design/wire-logic-conflict.png" width="500"> | <img src="/assets/images/design/wire-logic-or.png" width="500"> |

### Automatic wire layout

Let Antares automatically re-layout your wires when you move components.

<img src="/assets/images/design/wire-layout.gif" width="350">

### Aligning components

Let the align tool help you aligning components in complex circuits.

<img src="/assets/images/design/align.gif" width="500">

### Search for components in circuits

Use the search bar to search for components in a circuit based on names, labels, or component types.

<img src="/assets/images/user-manual/circuits/search-in-circuit.png" width="700">

### Circuit tests

Write test cases to check whether your circuit produces the expected outputs.

<img src="/assets/images/design/circuit-tests.png" width="700">

### Multi-circuit desktop

Open subcircuits in additional desktop views. Keep track of symbol-to-circuit relations by the color references created by Antares.

<img src="/assets/images/design/desktop.png" width="1000">

### Multi-window support

Open subcircuits in separate windows to take advantage of workplaces with more than one screen when working with complex projects.

<img src="/assets/images/design/multi-window.png" width="1000">

### Boolean Expressions and Circuit Synthesis

Define and edit truth tables, generate optimized boolean expressions (DNF), and let
Antares generate a combinational circuit that realizes these expressions.

<img src="/assets/images/user-manual/circuits/truth-table-sample.png" width="1000">

### Scripting

Use scripts to customize various parts of Antares' functionality and the
behaviour of your circuits. Scripts are written in a custom DSL (Domain Specific Language) that has been specially designed for dealing with
digital circuits.

<img src="/assets/images/design/scripting.png" width="600">

### Statistics

Let Antares deep dive into your circuit hierarchy and count how many subcircuits of each type are used, either for "Deep" or "Flat" traversal.
