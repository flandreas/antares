### High quality rendering

Draw beautiful circuits in publishing quality.

![Counter](/assets/images/design/counter.png)

### Rich component set

Use components from a rich built-in component library.

### Hierarchical design

Use your own circuits as subcircuits in other circuits. Organize these subcircuits
in libraries to use them in multiple projects.

### Symbol editor

Use the built-in symbol editor to draw custom symbols for your subcircuits.

### IEC and ANSI gate symbols

Switch between IEC and ANSI symbol style.

| IEC | ANSI |
| --- | ----- |
| <img src="/assets/images/design/iec-symbol-style.png" width="300"> | <img src="/assets/images/design/ansi-symbol-style.png" width="300"> |

### DIL symbols

Use the pre-defined DIL shape to wrap your custom circuit in a DIL shape, or
use the 74xx library in the Antares assets project.

### Dynamic and interactive custom symbols

Add subcircuit components like switches, LEDs or probes to your subcircuit's custom symbol
to let it display subcircuit state, and to let the user interact with internals
of your subcircuit, e.g. by pressing switches on the symbol.

### Individual symbol customization

Rotate or mirror a subcircuit's symbol, and even edit it individually for
optimal integration into its host circuit.

### True bi-directional signal flow

Pins, wires and wire splitters in Antares can be truly bi-directional, allowing
you to build bus-like circuits with ease.

### Wire bundles and bus-style wires

Combine multiple 1-bit wires to multi-bit bundles and denote bus-like wires.

### Automatic wire layout

Let Antares automatically re-layout your wires when you move components.

### Multi-circuit desktop

Open subcircuits in additional views.

### Scripting

Use scripts to customize various parts of Antares' functionality and the
behaviour of your circuits. Scripts are written in a custom DSL (Domain Specific Language) that has been specially designed for dealing with
digital circuits.
