This is the place where you can follow the development progress of Antares' web version.

[Level 5](../antares-web.html): More simulation UI controls (break, resume, simulation speed).

Supporting single step mode, simulation speed control and signal flow animation.

Next up: Dive down into subcircuits.

## History

**Level 4**: Simulate circuits with subcircuits (Load library circuits).

The sample circuit that can be loaded and simulated is the "Full Adder" from the
standard library. It contains two "Half Adders" that are loaded and simulated,
but it is not yet possible to dive into them, as it is possible with Antares desktop.

**Level 3**: Simulate circuit from standard library.

**Level 2**: Load and display circuit from standard library.

**Level 1**: Draw basic shapes. Various selection models. Drag and resize.
Zoom using the mouse wheel.
