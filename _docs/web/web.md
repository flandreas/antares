Although the Antares desktop client is already very powerful and provides many useful features for single users, essential parts of the Antares vision cannot be achieved with it alone. Therefore, in addition to the desktop client, we are striving for a cloud-based web version of Antares.

# Interactive online textbooks

With the help of Antares, it will be possible in the future for authors of digital technology textbooks to create online versions of their textbooks that contain interactive, animated circuits. This will supplement the author's explanatory text with interactive elements in which the student can interactively experience and deepen the subject matter.

This [example](../antares-web.html) shows how a page in an online textbook with Antares circuit elements might look.

The following example show how pages in an online textbook with Antares circuit elements might look like:

- [Binary Addition](../antares-web.html): Built as a ReactJS page.
- [Making Logic Gates from Transistors](/gates-from-transistors): Embedded iFrames in Jekyll blog page.

An essential element is the question of the form in which the textual content is created, supplemented by interactive Antares elements. We aim to provide plugins for common CMS systems that can be used to integrate Antares elements into online pages.

# Integration with course management and online homework assignments

As a complement to the online textbooks, authors will be able to capture students in their classes and send them online exercises that also include interactive circuit elements. The student can create, simulate, and save the requested circuits. Antares then provides support to the teacher in correcting these exercises.

# Integration with third-party learning platforms

Another possibility is to explore in the future whether Antares could be integrated with widespread learning platforms such as [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org) to enable these platforms to offer interactive learning units for digital circuits and computer design.
