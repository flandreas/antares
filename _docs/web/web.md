This is the place where you can follow the development progress of Antares' web version.

[Level 3](../antares-web.html): Simulate circuit from standard library.

The sample circuit that can be loaded and simulated is the "8 bit Shifter" from the standard library. Note that the simulation speed is based on speed catetory
"Observe" in order to showcase wire signal displaying. Simulation speed with
this category is significantly slower than with category "Use". But besides that, I've noticed that the redrawing speed in the browser is currently not sufficient, not only
during simulation, but especially for basic editing and zooming operations. I will
definitely have to work on this.

Next up: Simulate circuits with subcircuits (Load library circuits).

## History

**Level 2**: Load and display circuit from standard library.

**Level 1**: Draw basic shapes. Various selection models. Drag and resize.
Zoom using the mouse wheel.
