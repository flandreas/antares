## Download

[Windows](https://github.com/flandreas/antares/releases/download/v0.30.0/Antares-0.30.0.msi){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}
[macOS](https://github.com/flandreas/antares/releases/download/v0.30.0/Antares-0.30.0.pkg){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}

## Installation

### macOS

The Antares macOS installer is not yet signed with an Apple developer certificate (see [Apple User Guide page](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac)). If you trust me, you can install Antares using the following procedure:

1. In the Finder on your Mac, locate the downloaded installer.
2. Control-click the installer, then choose "Open" from the shortcut menu.
3. Click "Open".

If you don't trust me (which is perfectly fine), you should not install Antares this way and wait until I have an Apple developer certificate to sign the installer, or wait until the [web version](/docs/web) of Antares is available.

### Windows

Follow the instructions of the installer application. After successful installation, you'll find an alias icon on your Windows desktop you can use to start Antares.

## Usage

If your are new to Antares, you might want to check out the [First Steps](/user-manual/english/first-steps/first-steps) tutorial. Otherwise, go to [Releases](/docs/releases/releases/) to see what's new in the current release.
