### Internationalization

Specify text that describes your circuit in all supported languages (currently English and German).

### Rich tooltips

Hover over components, pins and wires to let them explain their purpose and
their current state during simulation.

### Gate mnemonics

Optionally enable gate mnemonics on logic gates to help beginner students
better remember their fuction.

### AND gate data path

Take benefit of the AND gate's data path visualization feature to
illustrate multiplexer's mode of operation.

### Dynamic custom symbols

Use Antares scripting to make your custom subcircuit symbols dynamic during
simulation, e.g. to highlight the data path of a multiplexer.

### RAM/ROM data view with scripted disassembler

Use Antares scripting to enhance the data view of your RAM/ROM memory
components with disassembled machine code.

### Scenarios

Writes scripts that allow Antares to recognize individual steps when simulating
your circuit, and assign explanation texts to be displayed when these
steps become active. Use single-step simulation mode to step through
the scenarios and read the explanation for every individual step.
