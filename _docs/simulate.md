### Simulate and interact

Simulate your designed circuit and interact with it during simulation.

### Event based simulation

Take advantage of Antare's event-based simulation algorithm that respects
gate's propagation delay and allows for multiple independent clocks.

### Simulation speed category

Seamlessly adjust the simulation's speed and let Antares display ever more details
with decreasing speed.

### Single step mode and breakpoints

Walk through a circuit's functionality using single step mode and resume simulation
whenever its approriate for you. Use the "Break" component to define conditions
in your circuit at which the simulation should pause.

### Signal flow animation

Let Antares animate the flow of bits and multi-bit signals along wires,
and even into and out of subcircuits.

### Dive into subcircuits

Dive down into arbitrary levels of subcircuits. Use the breadcrumb bar to keep
track of where you are, and to resurface to the level of your choice.

### Simulate complex circuits

Build and simulate complex, hierarchical circuits like entire microcomputers.

### Usecases and test scripts

Use Antares scripting to define complex circuit interaction usecases, and let your
users simply start these usecases to observe how the circuit behaves. Define test conditions for each usecase and let Antares run them to check if a circuit's logic is correct.

### Oscilloscope

Setup an oscilloscope in your circuit to capture signal curves during simulation. Choose between "clocked" and "real-time" (with propagation delay awareness) mode.
