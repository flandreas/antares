In this chapter you will learn how to create your own libraries. The basics of libraries are explained in link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/projects-libraries/projects-libraries["Projects and Libraries"].

== Manage libraries

The main menu menu:File[Libraries...] leads you to the Antares library management window.

The table shows all libraries available on your computer. These include the "Basic" and "Standard" libraries provided by Antares, as well as your own user libraries. The lock icon in the table indicates the type of library: User libraries (in the example "Test") show an open lock, while the build-in libraries, which you cannot change, are shown with a closed lock.

After selecting a library, the description of the library is displayed below the table.

btn:[Open]:: Opens the selected library. This action is useful if you want to create a new project based on the selected library afterwards.

btn:[New]:: Creates a new library. Besides the name of the new library, an already existing library can be used as a template. All elements of the template are copied into the new library; the new library will no longer have any connection to the template afterwards. Choose the base library as template if you want to create a new, rich library from scratch. You can later add additional elements from other libraries to your new library using the menu:Edit Library[] action (see below).

btn:[Delete]:: Deletes the selected library. This action cannot be undone. If you have projects based on the deleted library, these projects will no longer be usable.

btn:[Export]:: Exports the selected library to a ZIP file.

btn:[Import]:: Imports a library from a ZIP file. Importing can fail in one of the following situations:
[horizontally]
- *Invalid:* The imported ZIP file is invalid, i.e. it was probably not created by an export from Antares.
- *Name already exists:* Since the name of a library must be unique, Antares rejects the import of a library with an already existing name.

== Change properties

With the context menu menu:Properties[] on the library in the workbench you can change the name and description of a library.

Both features are internationalized, i.e. you can enter texts in all languages supported by Antares. The description is mainly used in the "Libraries" window.

== Edit library

The context menu menu:Edit library[] opens the window shown below.

image::user-manual/projects-libraries/libraries-edit-en.png[Edit,600,align="center"]

The "Edit Library" window allows you to add more components from all existing libraries to the currently open library. The window displays the source library to the left (the library from which components are fetched) and the destination library to the right (the library to which components are added).

Select the source library from the "Source" drop-down list. Open the directories in the source library, select the component to be added, and press the button between the two windows to copy the selected component. The component will be copied to the directory selected in the "Destination" library.

In the example above, the "Half Adder" of the Standard library has been copied to the "Arithmetic" directory of the current "Test" library.
