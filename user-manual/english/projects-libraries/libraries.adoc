In this chapter you will learn how to create your own libraries. The basics of libraries are explained in <<{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/projects-libraries/projects-libraries.adoc#, "Projects and Libraries">>.

== Manage libraries

The main menu menu:File[Libraries...] leads you to the Antares library management.

The table shows all libraries available on your computer. These include the "Basic" and "Standard" libraries provided by Antares, as well as your own user libraries. The lock icon in the table shows the difference: User libraries (in the example "Test") show an open lock, while the default libraries, which you cannot change, are shown with a closed lock.

After selecting a library, the description of the library is displayed below the table.

btn:[Open]:: Opens the selected library. This action is useful if you want to create a new project based on the selected library afterwards.

btn:[New]:: Creates a new library. Besides the name of the new library, an already existing library can be used as a template. All elements of the template are copied into the new library; the new library will no longer have any connection to the template afterwards. Choose the base library as template if you want to create a new, rich library from scratch. You can later add additional elements from other libraries to your new library using the menu:Edit Library[] action (see below).

btn:[Delete]:: Deletes the selected library. This action cannot be undone. If you have projects based on the deleted library, these projects will no longer be usable.

== Change properties

With the context menu menu:Properties[] on the library in the workbench you can change the name and description of a library.

Both features are internationalized, i.e. you can enter texts in all languages supported by Antares. The description is mainly used in the "Libraries" window.

== Edit library

The context menu menu:Edit library[] opens the window shown below.

It allows you to add more items from all existing libraries to the currently open library. The window displays the source library (the library from which components are fetched) on the left and the target library (the library to which components are added) on the right. Select the source library from the Source drop-down list. Open the directories in the source library, select the component to be added, and press the button between the two windows to copy the selected component. The component will be copied to the directory selected in the target library.

In the example, the "Half Adder" of the Standard library has been copied to the "Arithmetic" directory of the current "Test" library.
