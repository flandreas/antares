The Workbench is the part of the Antares user interface that displays the open project and the library in use, and allows you to use their circuits and create new circuits.

The example below shows the opened project "Microcomputer (Tannenbaum)", which is based on the library "Standard".

This chapter describes the properties and possibilities of the workbench, which apply equally to projects and libraries opened in it. The special properties of link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/projects-libraries/projects[Projects] and link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/projects-libraries/libraries[Libraries] are explained in the corresponding chapters.

== Structure

The contents of the workbench are displayed as a tree whose topmost branches represent the project (if available) and the library used. The leaves of the tree are either basic elements that are programmed in Antares or circuits that can be opened. You can also create directories to group circuits.

Depending on their type, the individual workbench elements offer a menu with actions that can be called by selecting the element and then clicking the right mouse button. Important actions can also be accessed via the main menu of Antares.

On each workbench element that can contain child elements (project, library, directory), you can use the popup menu menu:New directory[] to create a new directory in that element. Directories can be deleted in the same way. Note that when you delete directories, all elements contained in them are also deleted.

== Open a project/library

A project is opened via the main menu menu:File [Projects] and subsequent selection in the dialog that appears. In the workbench, not only the selected project is opened, but also the library that uses the project.

If a project consists of several circuits, one of these circuits is often the "main circuit" or "top circuit", which contains the other circuits as sub-circuits. In order for Antares to automatically open this main circuit when the project is opened, this main circuit can be marked with the popup menu menu:Open on Load[]. The name of this circuit is displayed [.underline]#underlined# in the workbench tree .

A library can be opened by selecting the main menu menu:File [Libraries] and then selecting it in the displayed dialog. Since libraries cannot use other libraries, the workbench in this case only shows the open library.

NOTE: It is rarely necessary to open a library manually. When you are working on a project, Antares will automatically open the library you are using. If you are developing a library, you can open the library by yourself. You can also have a test project open for the library you are using and still edit circuits in the library.

== Opening a circuit

You can open a circuit of a project or a library by double-clicking on the workbench element or by selecting its pop-up menu menu:Open circuit[]. The currently open circuit is indicated by an orange background of the icon in the workbench tree.

If you have made a change in the previously opened circuit that you have not yet saved, Antares will ask you if you want to save these changes.

Antares remembers which circuit was last opened when you close the application, and automatically reopens this circuit the next time you start it.

== Search for components

If your project or the library you are using contains a lot of components, possibly still structured with directories, it can be difficult to find a specific component. Therefore, the workbench contains a search field that can be used to search for component names. After each character entered, Antares reduces the tree to those components that contain the search text entered in the name.

== Selection of a component

If you select an elementary component or a partial circuit in the workbench tree, the preview above the workbench displays the component's icon as well as its name and short description (if available). This information helps you to identify the correct component before you add it to your circuit. You add the selected component to your circuit by dragging and dropping it into your circuit.

== Expand and collapse tree structure

On each tree item, which can contain subordinate elements, Antares offers you the two pop-up menus menu:Expand all[]] and menu:Collapse all[], which can be used to expand and collapse this element and all elements below it.

== Create new circuit

In the tree elements "Project", "Library" and "Directory" you can create a new circuit with the popup menu menu:New circuit[]. The newly created circuit is part of the currently open project and is therefore also based on the library that the project uses and that is currently open.

The name entered in the dialog is used as name in the currently selected user language. The name of the circuit can be translated into other languages in the properties view of the circuit. In the current version Antares does not ensure that the name is unique within the directory. Nevertheless it is recommended to use unique names.

The newly created, empty circuit is automatically opened by Antares.

== Move components

You can use drag & drop to move a component to another position within the directory, to another directory or even from a project to the library (and vice versa). Antares ensures that the following rules are followed:

* A circuit cannot be moved from the project to the library if it references other circuits in the project.
* The default Antares libraries cannot be changed.
