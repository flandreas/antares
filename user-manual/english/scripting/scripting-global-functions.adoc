/**
 * Computes the binary logarithm (base 2) of a given value.
 *
 * The result is rounded up to the next bigger integer value in order to
 * provide enough bits when used to calculate the number of necessary bits that
 * represent a number whose number of bits is given by [value].
 *
 * Examples:
 * - log2(8) = 3
 * - log2(10) = 4
 * - log2(16) = 4
