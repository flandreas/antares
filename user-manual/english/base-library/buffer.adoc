A buffer forwards the signal of the input unchanged to the output.

Unconnected inputs always have the value 0.

(Z: Undefined/High impedance, X: Error)

=== Mnemonics

The logical gates of Antares can illustrate their function with so-called "mnemonics". See the chapter link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/description/description[Descriptions and explanations]. The mnemonic of the buffer is shown below.
