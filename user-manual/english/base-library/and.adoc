== Behavior

The AND gate outputs the result of the AND function of the 1-bit signals at the input. The output has the value 1 only if all inputs have the value 1.

The behaviour for unconnected inputs or input wires carrying an undefined signal can be changed using the system preference
"Open Gate Input Behaviour".

== Data path

AND gates are often used in data path circuits in which one of several data paths is selected by means of control inputs. AND gates with n+1 inputs are used, where n is the number of bits required to select the data path.

The AND gate offers the possibility to visualize the data path. If the attribute "Data input" is set with the number of the input where the data path arrives, the AND gate draws the path from this input to the output. If the control inputs all have the value 1, the data path is drawn as a solid line. If one of the control inputs has the value 0, the AND gate disables and the data path is drawn as a dashed line.

The following example shows the use of data paths in the "4-1 Multiplexer" circuit of the standard Antares library.

=== Mnemonics

The logical gates of Antares can illustrate their function with so-called "mnemonics". See the chapter link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/description/description[Descriptions and explanations]. The mnemonic of the AND gate is shown below.

== Pins

Inputs:: The one-bit inputs of the AND gate. Their number is determined by the attribute "Number of inputs".

Output:: The 1-bit output of the AND gate. Outputs the value of the calculated AND function.

== Attributes

Orientation:: The direction in which the output points.

Number of inputs:: Determines how many inputs the AND gate has. There are 2 to max. 8 inputs available. Can even be changed if the gate is already connected to wires.

Negate input n:: When selected, the n-th input pin is negated. The maximum of "n" is determined by attribute "Number of inputs". Negation is also
applied to the truth table and the mnemonics displayed for the gate.

Output Name:: The optional name displayed next to the output. This can be useful if the AND gate is the end of a complex combinatorial circuit and the logical expression produced by the AND gate is to be specified.

Data Input:: In this attribute the number of the input containing the data path can be selected if the feature "data path" (see above) is to be used. In the direction of data flow through the AND gate, the number 1 designates the output at the top.
