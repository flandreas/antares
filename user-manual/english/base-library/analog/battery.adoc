== Behaviour

A battery provides a constant electrical voltage at its two outputs. Although real-world batteries don't act as ideal voltage source, an Antares battery does. The name "Battery" was chosen because it is more familiar from daily usage.

== Pins

A battery has two bi-directional pins. The positive pin annotated with "+" is the cathode and produces the positive voltage level as specified by the property "Voltage".

== Properties

Voltage:: The electrical voltage (V) produced by the battery.
