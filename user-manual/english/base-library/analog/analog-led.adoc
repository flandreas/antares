== Behaviour

An analog LED behaves the same as the diode component, except that it emits light if the current is above the lower limit.

If the user preference Circuit -> Analog -> Draw LED halo is enabled, Antares draws a nice halo during simulation. The brightness of the halo depends on the electrical current and the "Min. current" / "Max. current" properties.

Note:: Unlike in a real circuit, the LED in Antares doesn't become damaged (and stop conducting) if the current exceed a certain limit. However, above the max. current limit, the LED's brightness doesn't increase anymore.

== Pins

An LED has two bidirectional pins called anode and cathode.

== Properties

Light color:: The color of the light the LED emits. Can also be an expression containing a circuit parameter, such as "=LC".

Min. current:: The current (A) above wich the LED starts to emit light.

Max. current:: The current (A) at which the largest brightness is reached.

== Symbol control properties

LED Shape:: Determines whether the LED is drawn as a circle, a square, or a narrow stripe.
