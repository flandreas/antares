== Behaviour

This component simulates a MOSFET transistor.

The behaviour of a MOSFET transistor depends on its "Type" property. When used as a switch, a n-type MOSFET opens the drain-source path if the gate voltage is high, whereas a p-type MOSFET opens the drain-source path if the gate voltage is low.

Calculation of a MOSFET transistor during simulation uses a linearized model.

== Pins

A MOSFET transistor has 3 bi-directional pins:

Gate:: The single pin at the left side of the symbol.

Source:: The pin at the right side which is on the same height as the gate

Drain:: The pin at the right side which isn't at the same height as the gate.

== Properties

Name:: The name of the MOSFET is displayed to the right of the symbol.

Type:: Choose between "N" (representing n-type MOSFET) and "P" (representing p-type MOSFET).

Symbol:: Choose between "Bulk" or "Inverter" symbol style. This only changes the representation, not the behaviour during simulation. Note that the default "Transistor symbol" can be specified in the user preferences.

Control Input Orientation:: Determines whether source pin is located on the left or right side from the perspective of an incoming gate voltage.

Gain:: The relation between the gate voltage and the resulting drain/source current. With a value of 0.1, a gate voltage change of 1 Volt results in a drain/source current change of 0.1 Ampere (in linear region).
