== Behaviour

A resistor establishes electrical resistance between its two pins.

== Pins

The resistor has two bidirectional pins.

== Properties

Resistance:: The electrical resistance in Ohm.

Variable:: If checked, the resistor turns into a potentiometer. You can then click on the resistor during simulation to bring up a knob that allows you to change the resistance.
