== Behaviour

A capacitor stores electrical energy by accumulating electric energy on its plates.

== Pins

A capacitor has two bidirectional pins. Depending on the voltage at these pins, and the current charge of the capacitor, the capacitor charges or discharges, resulting in current flowing from or to the pins.

== Properties

Capacitance:: The capacitance of the capacitor in microfarad.
