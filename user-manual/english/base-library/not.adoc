== Appearance

== Behavior

The NOT gate inverts the signal at the input and outputs it at the output. If property
"Bit Width" is larger than 1, the "NOT" function is applied to each bit individually.

Unconnected inputs always have the value 0.

=== Mnemonics

The logical gates of Antares can illustrate their function with so-called "mnemonics". See the chapter link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/description/description[Descriptions and explanations]. The mnemonic of the NOT gate is shown below.

Mnemonics are only displayed if property "Bit Width" is 1.

== Pins

Input:: The input of the NOT gate. Its bit width is determined by property "Bit Width".
Output:: The output of the NOT gate, which outputs the inverted signal of the input. Its bit width is determined by property "Bit Width".

== Attributes

Orientation:: The direction in which the output points.

Bit Width:: The bit width of the signal that can be passed through the NOT gate.
