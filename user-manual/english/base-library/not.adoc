== Appearance

== Behavior

The NOT gate inverts the 1-bit signal at the input and outputs it at the output.

Unconnected inputs always have the value 0.

=== Mnemonics

The logical gates of Antares can illustrate their function with so-called "mnemonics". See the chapter <<{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/description/description.adoc#, Descriptions and explanations>>. The mnemonic of the NOT gate is shown below.

== Pins

Input:: The 1-bit input of the NOT gate.
Output:: The 1-bit-output of the NOT gate, which outputs the inverted signal of the input.

== Attributes

Orientation:: The direction in which the output points.
