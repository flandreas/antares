== Behaviour

A double-throw switch is a bi-directional real switch with three pins. It allows to connect a net
on one side with one of two possible nets on the other side of the switch.

When pressing the double-throw switch with the mouse, it receives the keyboard focus, which is represented by a thin blue dashed rectangle. If a double-throw switch has the keyboard focus, it can also be operated with the kbd:[Enter] key as well as with the keys kbd:[0] and kbd:[1].

== Pins

A double-throw switch has three pins whose bit width is derived from the property "Bit Width".

== Properties

Bit Width:: The number of bits of both pins.

Switch:: If this property is set (default), the switch remains in the pressed state after the user has released the mouse button (or the keyboard key that triggered the pressing of the switch).
