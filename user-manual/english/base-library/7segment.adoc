== Appearance

== Behavior

The 7-segment display contains 7 LEDs arranged in the form of a digit and one LED at the bottom right, which is used as a dot. The LEDs light up depending on the signals applied to the inputs. If a 0 is present, the LEDs are displayed in the dark representation of the selected light colour. If a 1 is present, the bright representation of the light colour is used.

The 7-segment display is available in three different sizes. For the size display, you can choose whether the pins are available as a group or individually.

== Pins

p:: Controls the decimal point

a-f-f:: Only available with the "Single" pin scheme. Controls the 7 segments of the display as shown in the figure above.

s:: Only available with the "Combined" pin scheme. Accepts an 8-bit value whose bits control the 7 segments of the display, whereby bit 0 corresponds to segment "a" and bit 6 to segment "g". The most significant bit is not used.

== Attributes

LED colour:: The color of the LEDs. The menu offers all light colors implemented in Antares for selection.

Size:: The 7-segment display can be displayed in the three sizes "large", "medium" and "small".

Pin Scheme:: This attribute is only available if the attribute "size" has the value "large". It determines whether a separate pin should be provided for each segment of the LED (value "Single"), or whether all 7 segments should be combined into a single 8-bit pin (value "Combined").
