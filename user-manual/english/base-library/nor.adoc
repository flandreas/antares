== Behavior

The NOR gate outputs the result of the NOR function of the 1-bit signals at the input. The output has the value 1 only if all inputs have the value 0.

The behaviour for unconnected inputs or input wires carrying an undefined signal can be changed using the system preference "Open Gate Input Behaviour".

The multi-bit version of the NOR gate will perform its one-bit transformation bitwise on its inputs.

=== Mnemonics

The logical gates of Antares can illustrate their function with so-called "mnemonics". See the chapter link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/description/description[Descriptions and explanations]. Below is the mnemonic of the NOR gate.

== Pins

Inputs:: The 1-bit inputs of the NOR gate. Their number is determined by the attribute "Number of inputs".

Output:: The 1-bit output of the NOR gate. Outputs the value of the calculated NOR function.

== Attributes

Orientation:: The direction in which the output points.

Number of inputs:: Determines how many inputs the NOR gate has. There are 2 to max. 8 inputs available. Can even be changed if the gate is already connected to wires.

Negate input n:: When selected, the n-th input pin is negated. The maximum of "n" is determined by attribute "Number of inputs". Negation is also
applied to the truth table and the mnemonics displayed for the gate.

Output Name:: The optional name displayed next to the output. This can be useful when the NOR gate is the end of a complex combinatorial circuit and the logical expression produced by the NOR gate needs to be specified.
