== Appearance

== Behavior

The NOR gate outputs the result of the NOR-gating of the 1-bit signals at the input. The output has the value 1 only if all inputs have the value 0.

Disconnected inputs always have the value 0.

=== Mnemonics

The logical gates of Antares can illustrate their function with so-called "mnemonics". See the chapter <<{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/description/description.adoc#, Descriptions and explanations>>. Below is the mnemonic of the NOR gate.

== Pins

Inputs:: The 1-bit inputs of the NOR gate. Their number is determined by the attribute "Number of inputs".

Output:: The 1-bit output of the NOR gate. Outputs the value of the calculated NOR function.

== Attributes

Orientation:: The direction in which the output points.

Number of inputs:: Determines how many inputs the NOR gate has. There are 2 to max. 8 inputs available. If the NOR gate is already connected to wires, this attribute cannot be changed.

Output Name:: The optional name displayed next to the output. This can be useful when the NOR gate is the end of a complex combinatorial circuit and the logical expression produced by the NOR gate needs to be specified.
