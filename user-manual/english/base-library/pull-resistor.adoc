== Behavior

A pull resistor pulls the signal of the wire to which it is connected to either 0 or 1, depending on its configuration.

If it is connected to a multi-bit wire, each bit of the wire's signal that is floating is pulled towards the configured direction, while the other bits of the signal are left unchanged.

== Pins

A pull resistor has only one output pin whose bit width is determined by the property "Bit Width".

== Properties

Bit Width:: The number of bits of the output pin.

Pull Direction:: The direction to which floating signal bits are pulled.
* **Low**: Floating bits are set to 0.
* **High**: Floating bits are set to 1.
