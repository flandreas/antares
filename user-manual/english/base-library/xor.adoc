== Behavior

The XOR gate (Exclusive OR) outputs the result of the XOR function of the 1-bit signals at the input. The output only has the value 1 if exactly one input has the value 1. For an XOR gate with two inputs, this means that the output is 1 if the two inputs have a different value.

(Z: Undefined/High impedance, X: Error)

The behaviour for unconnected inputs or input wires carrying an undefined signal can be changed using the system preference "Open Gate Input Behaviour".

The multi-bit version of the XOR gate will perform its one-bit transformation bitwise on its inputs.

=== Mnemonics

The logical gates of Antares can illustrate their function with so-called "mnemonics". See the chapter link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/description/description[Descriptions and explanations]. The mnemonic of the XOR gate is shown below.

== Pins

Inputs:: The 1-bit inputs of the XOR gate. Their number is determined by the property "Number of inputs".

Output:: The 1-bit output of the XOR gate. Outputs the value of the calculated XOR function.

== Properties

Orientation:: The direction in which the output points.

Number of inputs:: Determines how many inputs the XOR gate has. There are 2 to max. 8 inputs available. Can even be changed if the gate is already connected to wires.

Negate input n:: When selected, the n-th input pin is negated. The maximum of "n" is determined by property "Number of inputs". Negation is also
applied to the truth table and the mnemonics displayed for the gate.

Output Name:: The optional name displayed next to the output. This can be useful when the XOR gate forms the end of a complex combinatorial circuit and the logical expression produced by the XOR gate is to be specified.
