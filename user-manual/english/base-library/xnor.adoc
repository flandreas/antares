== Appearance

image:user-manual/base-library/xnor-sample.png[Example XNOR gate, 300].

== Behavior

The XNOR (Nexclusive OR) outputs the result of the XNOR function of the 1-bit signals at the inputs. The output has the value 1 only if not exactly one input has the value 1. For an XNOR gate with two inputs, this means that the output is 1 if both inputs have the same value.

Unconnected inputs always have the value 0.

=== Mnemonics

The logical gates of Antares can illustrate their function with so-called "mnemonics". See the chapter <<{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/description/description.adoc#, Descriptions and explanations>>. The mnemonic of the XNOR gate is shown below.

== Pins

Inputs:: The 1-bit inputs of the XNOR gate. Their number is determined by the attribute "Number of inputs".

Output:: The 1-bit output of the XNOR gate. Outputs the value of the calculated XNOR function.

== Attributes

Orientation:: The direction in which the output points.

Number of inputs:: Determines how many inputs the XNOR gate has. There are 2 to max. 8 inputs available. If the XNOR gate is already connected to wires, this attribute cannot be changed.

Output name:: The optional name displayed next to the output. This can be useful when the XNOR gate forms the end of a complex combinatorial circuit and the logical expression produced by the XNOR gate is to be specified.
