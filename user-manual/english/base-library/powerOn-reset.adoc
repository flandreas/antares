== Behavior

The "Power-On Reset" component can be used to bring a circuit into a defined state when the simulation gets started, i.e. when the circuit is "powered on".

When the simulation is started, the single output of the component immediately goes to 1 and stays there as long as its "Propagation Delay" property indicated. After that, the output goes back to 0 and stays there during the entire simulation.

Using the property "Logic" can invert this behaviour, such that the output goes to 0 and then back to 1 for the entire simulation.

== Pins

Output:: The component has a single output producing the reset signal.

== Properties

Propagation Delay:: Determines how long the output produces the reset signal before it goes back to its idle value.

Logic:: Determines whether the reset signal is 1 (with logic "Positive") or 0 (with logic "Negative").
