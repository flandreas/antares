== Behaviour

The lookup table component works much like the link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/base-library/rom[ROM] component, but without a CS input and with a much more compact look.

The lookup table consists of an internal read-only memory whose data cell bit with is determined by the property "Data Bit Width". The size of the memory (i.e. the number of cells) is determined by the property "Address Bit Width".

Just like with a ROM component, double-click the symbol and edit the memory values of the lookup table.

During simulation, whenever the value at the address input "A" changes, the lookup table value addressed by "A" gets looked up and presented at the data output "D".

== Pins

A:: Address Input. Its bit width is determined by property "Address Bit Width".

D:: Data Output. Its bit width is determined by property "Data Bit Width".

== Properties

Address Bit Width::  Determines the number of lookup table entries.

Data Bit Width:: Determines the number of bits of the lookup table entries.
