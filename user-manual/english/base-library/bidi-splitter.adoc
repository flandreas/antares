== Appearance

image:user-manual/base-library/bidi-splitter-sample.png[Splitter,300]

== Behaviour

The bi-directional splitter combines link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/base-library/splitter[splitter] and link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/base-library/combiner[combiner] in one single component and can therefore forward signals in both directions.

NOTE: Simulation of circuits containing bi-directional splitters is more time-consuming. Try to avoid them if you can and if simulation speed is a concern.

== Pins

All pins of bi-directional splitter are input/output pins.

== Properties

See link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/base-library/splitter[splitter] for a description of the various properties.
