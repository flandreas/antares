== Appearance

== Behavior

The OR gate outputs the result of the OR function of the 1-bit signals at the input. The output only has the value 1 if at least one of the inputs has the value 1.

Unconnected inputs always have the value 0.

=== Mnemonics

The logical gates of Antares can illustrate their function with so-called "mnemonics". See the chapter link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/description/description[Descriptions and explanations]. The mnemonic of the OR gate is shown below.

== Ports

Inputs:: The 1-bit inputs of the OR gate. Their number is determined by the attribute "Number of inputs".

Output:: The 1-bit output of the OR gate. Outputs the value of the calculated OR function.

== Attributes

Orientation:: The direction in which the output points.

Number of inputs:: Determines how many inputs the OR gate has. There are 2 to max. 8 inputs available. Can even be changed if the gate is already connected to wires.

Negate input n:: When selected, the n-th input pin is negated. The maximum of "n" is determined by attribute "Number of inputs". Negation is also
applied to the truth table and the mnemonics displayed for the gate.

Output Name:: The optional name displayed next to the output. This can be useful when the OR gate forms the end of a complex combinatorial circuit and the logical expression produced by the OR gate should be specified.
