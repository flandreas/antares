== Behaviour

Extends the bit width of a signed input value while preserving the sign. If the input is a single bit, this bit is set on all output bits.

== Pins

Input:: The input signal to be extended.

Output:: The extended output signal.

== Attributes

Input Bit Width:: The number of bits of the input pin. Must be smaller than "Output Bit Width".

Output Bit Width:: The number of bits of the output pin. Must be larger than "Input Bit Width".
