This chapter describes in detail how scripting can be used in link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/scenarios/scenarios[scenarios].

Scripting in use cases uses the link:{{site.basedir}}/user-manual/english/scripting/scripting-dsl[_Antares DSL_] programming language.

In addition to the standard ways of accessing signal values of inputs, outputs, or any ports of components, you can use the following standard scripting functions to achieve more fine-tuned scenario conditions.

 * @param state the required state with the following supported values:
