title: New scripting language
---

Release 0.13.0 of Antares brings an entirely new scripting language
that is much simpler to use than the old JavaScript based scripting
language, because it has been tailored for the specific needs of
dealing with digital circuits.

The change was also necessary to bring
Antares scripting to the web platform, because scripting with JavaScript
is not possible due to security reasons.

Other nice features you might also enjoy are the new single step mode,
the new popup keyboard on hex/decimal circuit inputs, and the possibility
to write subcircuit symbol scripts that change a symbol's label
during simulation.

Check out the [release letter](/docs/releases/release-0.13.0/index.html)
for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
