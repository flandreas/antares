title: Release 0.30.0 with 'Wire Tap' and Fixed Point Representation
---

Besides the usual bugfixes, release 0.30.0 also contains a couple of interesting new features.

![New features](/assets/images/release-0.30.0.png)

The new standard library component "Wire Tab" allows to to extract single bits from a bus. Much like a splitter, but lighter, and always bi-directional.

The probe component in the standard library has now options to configure a fixed point representation of a digital signal. This can be useful when developing arithmetic circuits.

There also some improvements in dark mode support on all platforms.

> :warning: **Breaking Change #419**: The behaviour of "Multiplexer n Bit" with undefined signals has been changed. Adjust your circuits if they use this component.
