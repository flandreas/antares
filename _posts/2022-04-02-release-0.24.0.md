See the new chapter in the [user manual](/user-manual/english/oscilloscope/oscilloscope) for a description on how to use the oscilloscope.

The oscilloscope still lacks experience out in the field, so please give us feedback what you think of it.

Check out the [release letter](/docs/releases/release-0.24.0/index.html)
for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
