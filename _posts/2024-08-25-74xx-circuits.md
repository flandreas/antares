title: Some new SN 74xx circuits
---

We've added a couple of new circuits to the SN 74xx library in the [Antares assets](https://github.com/flandreas/antares-assets) project:

- 74181: 4-Bit ALU
- 74373: Octal D-type latches
- 74138: 3-to-8 line decoder/demultiplexer; inverting
- 74574: 8-bit D-Type flip-flop
- 74245: 8-Bit Transceiver
- 74161: 4-Bit counter

If you want to contribute to that project, download the SN 74xx library, import it into your local Antares installation, and add more circuits. Before editing the library, don't forget to mark the imported library as "Owned by me", otherwise it will show as "locked".
