title: Antares Web <iframe> Integration
---

In the past couple of weeks, we've put a lot of time and effort into
pushing Antares Web to the next level.

After we've recently presented our first version of a sample
["Online textbook page"](/docs/web/antares-web.html) built with Antares,
we are now ready to showcase the first integration into a third-party system
(in this case a Jekyll blog page) using a HTML <iframe>.

<iframe style="border:none" width="800" height="400" src="/docs/web/iframe.html?project=532f0477-722c-4c88-ada3-c419a386d06a&circuit=e2252451-b870-4541-ac11-1ffe2aca72ca"></iframe>

The circuit in the <iframe> above is a sample one we've provided statically, so it's
currently not yet possible to publish your own circuits you've designed in the
Antares Desktop application. But that's actually the next big milestone we are
going for.
