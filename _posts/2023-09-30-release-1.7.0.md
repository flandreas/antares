title: Release 1.6.0
---

Release 1.7 brings besides some smaller features a lot of bug fixes, especially the fix for the severe bug #648, which could lead to corrupt circuit files when undoing wire junctions, and bug #613, which prevented you from changing properties of "Input/Output" components.

Also worth mentioning is the new feature #641: Antares now highlights coinciding pins not connected by a wire, a situation that can occur after copy/paste or after moving components with arrow keys, and that could lead to confused users and circuits not working as expected.
