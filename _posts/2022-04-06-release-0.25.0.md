title: Release 0.25.0 with simulation engine fix
---

The main reason for this release is a fix of a severe bug #341 in the simulation engine that could lead to infinite oscillation cross-coupled bi-directional circuits ports are used, such as like in the "Bus Transceiver" library component.

In addition to that, some minor bugs have been fixed as well, and some smaller features have been added, including the new "Bus Transceiver n Bit" component in the standard library.

for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
