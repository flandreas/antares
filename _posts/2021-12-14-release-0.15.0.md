title: Release 0.15.0 with Parametrized Circuits and Sound
---

Release 0.15 brings the powerful feature "Generic Parameters of Subcircuits" that
allows you to parametrize a circuit with a bit width and choose the actual bit width
when using the circuit as a sub circuit.

Another fun feature is the new buzzer component, which you can you to play sounds
of arbitrary frequency and volume.

In addition to that, the standard library has been extended by new n-bit
adder, substractor, multiplier and divider components.

for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
