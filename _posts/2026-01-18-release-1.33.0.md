Besides the usual bug fixes and improvements, there are also two new features worth mentioning.

Logic gates now support three different sizes.

LEDs now support a new property "Shape" with possible values "Circle", "Square" and "Stripe". This brings more flexibility when using LEDs in symbol controls, e.g. for building a 7-segment display "from scratch".
