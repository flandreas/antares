title: New Module "Analysis" in 0.22.0
---

Release 0.22.0 extends the "Synthesis" module introduced in 0.21.0 by adding the
possibility to enter boolean expressions and minimize them. See the updated user manual
page ["Synthesis"](/user-manual/english/circuits/synthesis) for a description of this feature.

In addition, release 0.22.0 introduces a new "Analysis" module allowing you to analyse a
combinational circuit and generating minimized boolean expressions that you can store and/or convert into a truth table. This new feature is explained in the user manual page ["Analysis"](/user-manual/english/circuits/analysis).

Check out the [release letter](/docs/releases/release-0.22.0/index.html)
for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
