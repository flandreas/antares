title: Release 1.10.0 with analog circuits
---

Besides some improvements of the VHDL export feature, the main new feature of this release are analog circuits.

Use the analog module to play around with electrical voltage and current, experience Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s law through current flow simulation and voltage display by color, and build logic gates from real MOSFETs, but don’t expect Antares to be a fully-fledged analog simulator tool.

Check out the [release letter](/docs/releases/release-1.10.0/index.html) for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
