title: Release 1.14.0
---

Besides the usual bugfixes and minor features, this release brings the bigger features "Overview of global signals" and "Non-volatile RAM". There are also some improvements in Antares Web, like image thumbnails in the projects overview page.

We've also completed a couple of Antares Web issues with this release, but we've encountered technical issues during deployment to the cloud. We hope to fix them in the next couple of days. We expect new Antares Desktop release to still work with the current Antares Web backend. If you encounter problems, let us know.

Check out the [release letter](/docs/releases/release-1.14.0/index.html) for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
