title: Release 0.5.0 with true bi-directional splitting
---

It took me quite a long time to implement it, and it was hard, but finally here it is:
Antares now features true bi-directional splitting!

Bi-directional splitting is primarily implemented in the new build-in component
"Bi-directional splitter". The new "Bus Transceiver" component is based on this new
splitter and can be used to attach components to a common bi-directional data bus.

To make this new components possible, a complete rework of Antares' signal
propagation algorithms was required, including new features for signal conflict
handling on bi-directional busses.

Check out the [release letter](/docs/releases/release-0.5.0/index.html)
for a description of what has changed with the new release, and the
[simulation](/user-manual/english/simulation/simulation.html) chapter in the user manual
for more detailed information.
