title: New Module "Synthesis" in 0.21.0
---

Release 0.21.0 brings the entirely new module "Synthesis", which allows you to define
truth tables, to let Antares create optimized boolean expressions from a truth table,
and finally generate a circuit that realizes these expressions. See the corresponding new chapter ["Synthesis"](/user-manual/english/circuits/synthesis) in the user manual for an explanation of these new features.

Besides that, zoom factors and camera positions (pan) when diving into sub circuits and
returing from sub circuits have been substantially improved.

Check out the [release letter](/docs/releases/release-0.21.0/index.html)
for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
