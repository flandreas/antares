title: Release 0.20.0
---

Besides some bugfixes, improved simulation speed, and the new "Double-Throw Switch"
component, the most awaited feature is probably #309, which allows you to define a
circuit output as "Tri-State Output", allowing its corresponding sub circuit symbol pin
to be connected to wires with other outputs.

Check out the [release letter](/docs/releases/release-0.20.0/index.html)
for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
