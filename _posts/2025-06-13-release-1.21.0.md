title: Release 1.21.0
---

Besides fixes of a couple of 'Unexpected errors' reported by the new feature that uploads descriptions of these errors, a new notable feature is "Auto-adjust bit with when connecting components".

If you connect a new component that has a bit width property (e.g. a circuit input) with a wire whose bit with is already determined (e.g. by a 4-bit circuit output), the bit width of the newly added component is automatically adjusted to match the net's bit width. If you don't like this feature, you can disable it in the user preference "Circuit -> Adjust bit width to connected net".

Check out the [release letter](/docs/releases/release-1.21.0/index.html) for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
