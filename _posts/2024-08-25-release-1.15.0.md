title: Release 1.15.0
---

The timing of this release is mainly determined by some urgent bugfixes, especially the translation bugs that prevented users with German locales from using Antares.

Besides that, the main new features evolve around the new analog capacitor component, which paved the path to a new monoflop subcircuit in the standard library, a new timing-related DSL scripting function, and some improvements of the oscilloscope that are especially, but not exclusively useful when applied to analog circuits.

Also note that we recently updated the SN 74xx library in the Antares assets project with some additional circuits (see the separate [blog post](/74xx-circuits)).
