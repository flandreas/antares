title: Release 1.6.0
---

Various bugfixes and new features, most notably "Subscript in component names (Rich Text)" and a fix for "Dead components", which was a result of the circuit model becoming inconsistent during certain user actions.

In order to be able to track down issues like #584 "Dead components", logging has been massively extended, and Antares now does additional checks to detect such situations, in which case it asks the user to export the entire system state and upload it to a support issue for further analysis.

for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
