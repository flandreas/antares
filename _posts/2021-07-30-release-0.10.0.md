title: Happy anniversary release 0.10.0
---

I am proud and happy to present today the tenth Antares minor release!

The last one and a half years since release 0.1.0 have been a very special time,
obviously for all of us due to the still ongoing pandemic, but also personally for me,
because it was such a productive and satisfying time to steadily improve Antares.
And once again, big thanks to my pioneer users for their steady, ever constructive
feedback and support! Without you, Antares would not be where it is today.

So that being said, go and check out the new release 0.10.0 and enjoy its new features,
especially the new and mighty auto-connect wizardness :-)

Also check out the [release letter](/docs/releases/release-0.10.0/index.html)
for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
