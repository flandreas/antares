title: Release 0.19.0
---

Besides the new feature "Reconnect wire to existing wire", this release fixes
two severe bugs.

The first performance bug prevented users from simulating very
large and deeply nested projects, because loading and linking of lots of subcircuits
prior to simulation start seemingly stalled Antares. This has now been fixed: A test project
with almost 100'000 sub circuit instances now takes about 10 seconds to start
on our test machine.

The second severe bug in the "ROM Contents View" could lead to data loss when
manually editing ROM data cells. This has been fixed as well.

for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
