> :warning: **Breaking Change #879**: The change in the boolean operator precedence might influence the results of your Antares scripts during simulation.

Note that issue #808 "Open project in Antares Web" was planned to be part this release too. This feature made it necessary to change the way authentication is handled in the web app. Unfortunately, it turned out that what worked well in the development environment, didn't work correctly in the cloud. We didn't want to wait longer with deploying the desktop feature, so the code in the web applications is still on 1.16.0 level. This will work with older circuits, but not with circuits built with 1.17.0 due to issue #871 "Versioning of circuit and library files". Therefore:

> :warning: **Antares Web**: At the moment, don't upload projects built with 1.17.0 to Antares Web. It won't work.

Before we can fix this issue, we'll have to setup a staging area for all our browser applications on the various cloud platforms we are using. This will take some time. Until them, have fun with the new Antares Desktop features!
