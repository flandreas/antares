title: Release 0.29.0 with 'Search in circuits'
---

Starting with this release, you can now search for components in a circuit. Press
Alt-Ctrl-F (or Alt-Cmd-F on Mac) to display the search bar. If you enter a search term characters in the search field, Antares selects the components that match that search term.

See the new section ["Searching in Circuits"](/user-manual/english/circuits/circuits) in the user manual for a more in-depth description of this new feature.

Also worth mentioning are the new "Transmission Gate" component and a new feature in the tunnel component allowing you to indicate signal flow directions in tunnels.

> :warning: **Breaking Change #392**: The 'D Flip-Flop PRE/CRL' circuits in the standard library have been changed to edge-triggered behaviour. Adjust your circuits if they use these components.

for a more in-depth description of what has changed with the new release.
