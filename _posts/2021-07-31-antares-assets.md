title: Sharing Antares Assets
---

There is now a public [GitHub project](https://github.com/flandreas/antares-assets) where users can publish and share their circuits, projects and libraries.

Once I've implemented [issue #215](https://github.com/flandreas/antares/issues/215) (export/import of libraries), I will publish the current version of a SN74xx DIL library.
